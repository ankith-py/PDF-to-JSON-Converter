# PDF to JSON Converter
This application was deployed in Flask and allows users to upload PDF research articles via direct file upload or inputting URL link. Once the PDF is successfully uploaded, 
users have the option to preview the extracted text with major section titles and line breaks, download the newly converted JSON file with major section labels, or upload a new PDF. Please set the 'templates' folder that contains the html files as a templates folder in Python. The 'uploads' folder will contain the PDFs that are uploaded through the 'Upload' button on the web application. Ensure that all necessary libraries are installed before running the .py files.

**Disclaimer: This application may not work as intended for some PDF files due to different formatting patterns and section titles within a PDF.**
